# Causal React Frontend
Typescript - React - Reactflow - Antd


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`
### `yarn start`
### `yarn start dev`

the main code so far is in the src under initial nodes and the flow. I beleive the way to go is to make more then just the stnadard node class
